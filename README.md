# [RyukkMap] üéØ
Background Story: Ryuk, the Shinigami, was tired of writing in his Death Note, so he created RyukkMap, a virtual guide for tracking souls. While designed for reapers, this tool could be useful to humans for insights into high-risk areas and unexplained deaths‚Äîif it ever fell into their hands.

RyukkMap: The Reaper's Tool App Summary: RyukkMap is a fictional app designed for soul reapers, offering a 3D map view of the world with animated visuals of houses, souls, and living beings. Reapers can click on locations to view details about souls, causes of death, and living beings (seen via an infrared filter). An AI component allows the reaper to pinpoint souls or people by inputting characteristics, and toggles show overlays like death rates, accident spots, and population density
